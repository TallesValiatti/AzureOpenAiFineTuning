# Customizing Azure OpenAI Models with Fine-Tuning

This repository demonstrates how to utilize the Azure OpenAI model `40-mini` to efficiently summarize resume data, leveraging fine-tuning techniques to optimize token usage. 

The project showcases the complete implementation process, from integrating Azure OpenAI into a .NET application to customizing the model with fine-tuning. By applying fine-tuning, the solution achieves improved token efficiency, making it ideal for processing large volumes of resumes without sacrificing the quality of the summaries.
